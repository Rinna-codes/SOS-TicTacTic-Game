## ✍️ Process
The general process of developing the game was conducted through five separate sprints throughout the Fall-Winter season of 2025 (August-December), each implementing different features and major components that evenutally resulted in the completed, final version of this SOS TicTacToe game. There were precisely six sprints;
* **Sprint #0** was primarily focused on the planning/brainstorming stage of project by figuring out what language was best to use, what style guide to follow, what unitx test too implement, what graphic user interface (GUI) to use, and hard code the layout of the game would look like. 
* **Sprint #1** was documenting and maneuvering the requirements of the software by stating the user stories and the acceptance criteria for the human player in simple and general game modes against a another human opponent.
* **Sprint #2** is implementing the features of basic game options, initiating the game, and S/O human player placement on game board. First sprint to implment the user interface of the game.
* **Sprint #3** was the implementation of the logic of a human player playing in a simple or general SOS game against another human opponent, refactoring of code.
* **Sprint #4** involved implementing the features of selecting between a human or computer player during a simple or general SOS game mode against another player (human/computer).
* **Sprint #5** was the last spring of implementing the feature to record a game into a text file and being able to replay said text file.
